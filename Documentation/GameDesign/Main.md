# Questions that need answers

1. The Room suggests a level of player driven personality, but there are no other mechanics driven by this
2. Normally, platformer games like this game's references are locked personality wise, most rely on a very charismatic character (astro, mario, crash, ratchet and clank, etc). how will this game provide value aside from raw game feel, will it lean on more to personalization or to a charismatic mascot?
3. What's the identity of the game besides raw game feel?
